
Bonus eye effect is bad, I regret it. The actual spin is bad 
The wheel bobs up and down while it spins, can you see that? 
The video backgrounds I chose will make everything better but I thought you could improve the spin

The entrance is perfect
The eye bonus transition is perfect

The wheel segments don’t match the icons on result 
The spin is faster not smoother.

The top segment (12 o clock) is the chosen result so it’s much better without the pointer that’s good

Bonus eye is too glitchy looking. Need a high quality effect + the 1 of 8 results.

No the plain symbols are fine, I just hate the way the slot reel effect is so cheap looking
Instead of the rolling slot effect we should have them change in place? Then it’s one of 8 *combinations of symbols / results) -  with one of 3 outcomes)


The opening of the eye is much better than before it’s perfect now. For slot game the eye zoom in transition is perfect, where you zoom into the pupil. 

For the slot reel effect don’t do a traditional slot effect because that looks bad in your last example. Have the symbols pulse or switch somehow else.
